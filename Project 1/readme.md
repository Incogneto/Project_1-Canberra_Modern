# Website Creation

### the website we are to recreate 
https://canberramodern.com/


### What could be done with it?


### Introduction
For this project, we were tasked with creating a modern and responsive website for 'Modern Canberra'. 
'Modern Canberra' is a place to raise awareness of Canberra's historic buildings through community engagement. The main focus for this project was to make a website that makes it clear and easy to see what is happening and to get involved.


### Ideate
After sketching some ideas on what the website could be, it was most to make a clean and easy to understand landing page. 
the initial plan was to put as much on the main page as possible, removing them from the large amount of menu options at the top of the page.


### Front Page
The landing page takes care of the original pages 'About', and 'Partners' by placing them at the bottom of the landing page. On top of placing those pages on the main page, there is also images of the buildings that they care for and upcoming events


### Buildings
While going through the process of creating the main building page, it had occurred to me that creating a template that I could replicate would be great to keep a consistent theme between pages. This would allow me to create a landing page for all the buildings without clogging up the page with words that didn't need to be there yet.

As for the main building page, it is a grid of all the buildings in colour. When you hover over the building, it will present you with the name of the building and shade the image with a colour associated with the level of threat that building is in. This is to spark intrigue into what is happening with that building.

Green for 'No Threat'
Orange for 'Medium Threat'
Red for 'Extreme Threat'
Gray Scale for 'Demolished'

On the chosen building page, there will be a gallery like platform. With one hero image that can rotate between photos as the main element on the page, it will have many other photos underneath it. This will let people clock of those photos to manually change the photo that they are looking at.


### Events
The events page will be kept simple. Mainly it will be in 2 columns. Each event will have a hero picture on top, the time, date, and cost (if there is a cost) of the event. Under that will be a brief description of the event.
This can then be multiplied down the page until all events have been listed.

At the top of this page will be 'Upcoming Events', and underneath it will be 'Past Events'. Both sections will contain the same type of information. This is so when the event has passed, you can just change where on the page the event is.


### Media
The media will be a page dedicated to the articles, gallery of past events, videos, and links.

The idea for this would be to have a grid of 3 items. These would have a description of that is contained in each and lead the user to a page dedicated to that information. 

The article and video page, would each be in one column on separate pages.
The gallery page, would follow the same idea that the building option page follows.
The links page would be in 2 columns with a short descriptor on what the link is going to.


### Reflection
With poor time management and task importance, where I would get stuck on a small thing instead of the big picture, I have been able to pull together something that is not quite what I would have liked to achieve. A lot of the small visual styling have not been implemented. These would go a long way to making the website feel more complete and modern, while in its current state, it feels unfinished.

I did deviate from the sketched out plan from the beginning, in favor of how I was able to make it look with my rough understanding of HTML and CSS. There were a lot of times when I was trying to fix something in the wrong area of both CSS and HTML, which ate a lot of time and progress.

Dealing with the 'building option' page, I was not able to achieve what I had wanted to do with the colours on hover. 

While I do think that the original website would have been rather good, the amount of brick walls that I have encountered have seemed disproportional. This has led to many compromises and failing to produce a final product in any deliverable state

TL;DR
I have not been good at task management this semester, which has lead to a slippery slope.

### Things that I would have liked to have gotten finished
- I would have loved to get some more understanding on test decoration and implemented it.
- Replace all the stock images with the correct images.
- Implement all building pages with correct images and text
- Implement the events page with images and text
- Implement the resources page with off shooting pages that would lead to the corresponding information
- Make header work with media queries
- Implement the colour system for the building option page (trying to make this part work caused me to scrap the page 3 times)
- Fix the sign-up section on the main page
